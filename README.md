# speedSurvey

This is the most recent completed version of the Speed Survey. 

Speed Survey allows users to make an online poll with up to 4 options. The user can then share a link that is given for that question to have others participate in real-time updates to the poll.

## Tools 
- AngularJS
- AngularFire
- Firebase 2
- Bootstrap 3

## Structure
  For the most part for my config, modules and controllers I used the John Papa's AngularJS style guide (https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide). 
  
## Future updates
  * Will add a way for users to have more than 4 options maximum.
  * Looking for a way to restrict users from voting more than once. Preferably without using IPs.
